CORS error localhost:3000 not allowed to talk to localhost:8000 i.e.
localhost/:1 Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/patients/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. 
If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

Solution:
need to configure the Django backend to allow requests from the SolidJS frontend
```pip install django-cors-headers```
update ```settings.py``` by adding ```corsheaders``` to INSTALLED_APPS

Add middleware for CORS:
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    # other middleware
]

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    'http://localhost:3000',  # SolidJS frontend
]
```
